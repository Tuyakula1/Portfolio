**Loan Default Prediction Project**

**Overview:**

This project aims to predict loan default using machine learning techniques. The prediction model helps financial institutions assess the risk associated with granting loans to applicants by predicting whether a loan applicant is likely to default based on historical loan data.

**Key Features:**

**Data Collection:** Obtain a dataset containing historical loan data, including applicant's demographics, financial information, and loan details.

**Data Preprocessing:** Clean the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into the data through visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the distributions, correlations, and patterns within the data.
Model Building: Build machine learning models using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict loan default.

**Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Deployment:** Deploy the trained model into production using frameworks like Flask or FastAPI for real-time prediction.
